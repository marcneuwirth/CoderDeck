CoderDeck
=========
Create interactive live-coding presentations for the web.

CoderDeck combines Deck.js with the CodeMirror2 highlighting code editor to 
make it easy to demo and teach live HTML, CSS and Javascript directly in the browser.

Building your own Decks
==================

Run `make` to install the submodules of deck.js and codermirror2 and uglify and minify everything into the dist directory,
then copy the `sample-dist.html` along with the `dist/` directory to another directory, use `sample-dist.html` as a 
starting point or make your own.

`dist/coderdeck.css` is an optional theme made for coderdeck - you can use try other deck.js themes (let us know how they work)
